Facial Recognition using OpenCV

A facial recognition/detection project using OpenCV and my webcam. Images of people are encoded and detected, then the 
names of the subjects in the images are added to an "Attendance" sheet at the time they were detected. Usually I see 
facial detection projects that use popular tech people as the test subjects, I wanted to apply that faces of people I 
actually know.

I definitely did not use the most flattering pictures of the people that I know, but I did not want to make it easy for 
the algorithm to detect a face.
