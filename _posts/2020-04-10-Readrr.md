Readrr (Team Project)

A web app project used to keep track of a user's books, those that are currently being read, and those that have been 
read. A user may rate the books on their virtual shelf and allow for other users to view their ratings. This was a 
greenfield project and the data science team was tasked with setting the parameters for the project as it applies to 
data science. 

We set goals to use NLP and predictive modeling based on reviews and book features. 

I was responsible for the implementation of a k-nearest neighbors model on a database of 10K books. Recommendations 
were based on user ratings to find and suggest books to the user that would fit their profile.
